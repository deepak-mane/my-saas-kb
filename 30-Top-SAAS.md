  - # The Top 30 SaaS Companies & Products to Watch in 2019 

It's undeniable that software as a service (or SaaS) is growing rapidly. In fact, based on a survey conducted by BetterCloud, 73% of organizations who responded said that at least 80% of their apps will be SaaS by 2020. That’s a percentage that's expected to grow past 2020, too.

## What is a SaaS company?
Saas companies are organizations that use software to provide customers with a service. These businesses create, develop, host, and update the product all from one central location. SaaS businesses have immediate access to an unrestricted global market and can grow without raising product delivery costs.

SaaS is changing the way organizations work. SaaS products distribute data online to be accessible from a browser on any device. Companies can then continue to host the software and provide constant IT support. This allows for stronger network security, greater collaboration, additional features, and straight-forward, upfront prices.

## SaaS Products
SaaS products are software products that are hosted by a central provider and offered to customers through the internet. Rather than having to install or download a copy of the application, users can access the product from a web or mobile browser. The product’s provider then manages and updates the software based on user needs.

The company’s product will determine whether the organization is B2B or B2C. B2B SaaS companies have to focus on customer needs that are specific to business owners and management teams.

## B2B SaaS 
B2B SaaS refers to companies that sell software to other businesses as a service. These products help organizations run more efficiently or automate internal functions. Many businesses rely on these services to optimize their marketing, sales, and customer service efforts.

Since their products help businesses achieve goals, B2B SaaS companies are deeply invested in customer success. When customers succeed, they’re more likely to remain loyal to the SaaS business. This fosters mutual growth between the company and its customers.

Some SaaS companies have stood out from the crowd this year — which is a tough feat to accomplish in their respective markets. To give you an idea of what these organizations look like, we've curated a list of the strongest, fastest-growing, and biggest SaaS companies that you can learn from in 2019.
