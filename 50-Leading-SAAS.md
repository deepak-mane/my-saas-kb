# 50 Leading SaaS Companies
[Reference :Andy Patrizio article](https://www.datamation.com/cloud-computing/50-leading-saas-companies.html)
SaaS companies are leading the way in this new era of tech. Here’s a extensive survey of the SaaS companies that are shaping the market.

SaaS companies are clearly on the upswing, aided by the rapid growth of the larger cloud computing market. Years ago, much of the emphasis in the tech industry was around packaged software. Today, good luck launching a startup based on packaged software only. All the interest and energy (not to mention venture capital) is going to on-demand software-as-a-service (SaaS), since it promises to alleviate the headache of client installs and updates.

New companies are being launched, and most impressively, old guard software firms are engaging in impressive reinventions as SaaS providers. So here is a list of 50 SaaS companies of note with a little bit of everything mixed in.
