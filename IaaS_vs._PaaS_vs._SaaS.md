### What the heck is "the cloud?"

It seemed like such a simple question, I didn't have the courage to come out and ask it. So, like any good blogger, I resorted to the internet to figure it out.

And what I learned is, "the cloud" is a pretty big deal that powers how a lot of modern technology companies operate.

Start solving for the customer today with these 17 templates. 
You see, the cloud refers to how and where data is stored -- and perhaps more importantly, where it isn't. The cloud allows software and services to run on the internet, instead of only locally on one device, because the data is stored remotely across a variety of different servers. These software and services can be accessed on any internet browser, or via online apps that can be accessed on different devices.

One key example: the cloud lets your team collaborate on Google Docs instead of forcing you to work on one Microsoft Word document and send it around to each other.

As you might have guessed, thinking about all of the other services you can access from any online device, the cloud is a big deal. You might also be wondering, how are these cloud-based services built? You'll learn how different cloud computing services are used to build the technologies you use every day in this blog post. And if you're still confused about the cloud, don't worry -- clearer skies are ahead.

### IaaS vs. PaaS vs. SaaS: What's the Difference?
IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS stand for the three main categories of cloud computing. Cloud computing is the practice of using a network of different servers that host, store, manage, and process data online -- in "the cloud" I mentioned earlier. Here's a breakdown of the different ways businesses are monetizing cloud computing to offer customers different types of online services:

### IaaS
IaaS stands for "infrastructure as a service." It refers to cloud-based infrastructure resources that are delivered to organizations via virtualization technology that help organizations build and manage their servers, network, operating systems, and data storage. 

IaaS customers can control their own data infrastructure without having to physically manage it on-site. Instead, they can access and store data on servers via a dashboard or API (application programming interface).

#### What Does IaaS Do?
IaaS helps companies build and manage their data as they grow, paying for the storage and server space that they need to build hardware or software, without having to actually host and manage servers themselves on-site. IaaS products make up the foundations of building new technologies delivered over the cloud.

#### IaaS Examples
  1. Amazon Web Services (AWS)
AWS is overseen by Amazon and is used for on-demand cloud computing and purchased for on a recurring subscription basis. AWS helps companies store data and deliver content -- in fact, it's helping you read this blog post right now.

  2. Microsoft Azure
Microsoft Azure is a cloud-computing IaaS product that allows for building, testing, and managing applications through a network of Microsoft data centers.

#### IaaS Pros & Cons
IaaS cloud infrastructure offers companies and administrators the greatest level of control and power over software and hardware, but they'll also be responsible for making sure they're technologically secure and running properly to avoid causing outages in critical parts of your company's operations.

### PaaS
PaaS stands for "platform as a service." It refers to cloud-based platform services that provide developers with a framework they can use to build custom applications upon. 

In this way, PaaS isn't delivering software over the internet, but it is providing an online platform that's accessible to different developers to create software delivered over the internet.

#### What Does PaaS Do?
PaaS products let developers build custom applications online without having to deal with data serving, storage, and management.

#### PaaS Examples
  1. Google App Engine
Google App Engine allows developers to build and host web applications in cloud-based data centers that Google manages.

  2. OpenShift
OpenShift is an on-premises containerization PaaS software.

#### PaaS Pros & Cons
The biggest advantage of the PaaS model is how much control it provides IT administrators over the platform software and applications are being built upon. The disadvantage of the PaaS model is you can only control what's built on the platform -- if there is an outage or issue with the hardware or operating system that platform is built on, it will take out the software with them.

#### IaaS vs. PaaS
IaaS offers administrators more direct control over operating systems than PaaS, but PaaS offers users greater flexibility and ease of operation.

Next up, let's dive into SaaS -- the acronym you're likely most familiar with.

### SaaS
"SaaS" stands for "software as a service." It refers to cloud-based software that is hosted online by a company and is available for purchase on a subscription basis and is delivered via the internet.

#### What Does SaaS Do?
SaaS products are among the most commonly-used cloud computing services used by companies to build and grow their businesses. SaaS is easy to use and manage, and it's highly scalable, as it doesn't need to be downloaded and installed on individual devices in order to deploy it to an entire team or company. This is particularly helpful for distributed global teams of people who don't work in close physical proximity.

#### SaaS Examples
  1. JIRA
JIRA is a project management software that's delivered by Atlassian and can be purchased on a subscription basis by customers.

  2. Dropbox
Dropbox is a file-sharing SaaS tool that allows multiple users within a group or organization to upload and download different files.

#### SaaS Pros & Cons
The biggest advantage of using SaaS products is how easy they are to set up and start using: Because SaaS products are cloud-based, all you need to do is log online to start accessing the online applications and start using them, without need for locally hosting the software on servers on the premises of your office or business.

However, this ease of use lends itself to the disadvantage of using SaaS products: When you use a SaaS product, you have no control over the cloud-based infrastructure it runs on, so if the software provider experiences an outage, so do you. This can lead to widespread website outage and issues that can, in turn, impact your business processes that require SaaS products to operate.

#### What's the Difference?
To examine the differences between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS, think of these terms as under the umbrella of cloud-computing (building, creating, and storing data over the cloud), and think about them in the order we've presented them.

IaaS helps build the infrastructure of a cloud-based technology. PaaS helps developers build custom apps via an API that can be delivered over the cloud. And SaaS is cloud-based software companies can sell and use.

Think of IaaS as the foundation of building a cloud-based service -- whether that's content, software, or the website to sell a physical product, PaaS as the platform on which developers can build apps without having to host them, and SaaS as the software you can buy or sell to help software companies (or others) to get it all done.

#### SaaS vs. PaaS
SaaS products are fully managed by another company, from the applications to the data to the servers, whereas PaaS products can be used as the foundation for building new products on top of the platform's network. With both products, there is a risk of external management data issues compromising the functionality or security of the tools you're using. SaaS is best for companies looking for an out-of-the-box ease of use, and PaaS is best for companies looking to build a solution on an existing network.

### Basically, the PaaS market has six primary components.
- Foundational PaaS — New applications targeting a highly fluctuating number of users.
- Application PaaS — Custom or packaged applications extending major SaaS applications or an ecosystem of business apps on the same platform. (Emphasis added, for reasons that should soon become clear.)
- Process PaaS — Apps focused on business processes running on a platform that provides modeling, execution, and simulation, extended by a basic programming "container."
- Integration PaaS — Apps and "mash-ups" focused on cloud-legacy and cloud-cloud integration.
- Legacy PaaS — Legacy applications migrated from mainframes or traditional C/C#/Java runtime platforms.
- Content PaaS — Apps focused on content management and document-centric collaboration.

### ServiceNow: Taking a Pass on PaaS to Focus on What Enterprises REALLY Want and Need
- [by MichaelDortch](https://community.servicenow.com/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=1e4e66addbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961931)

Forrester and others have identified scores of incumbent, upstart, and emerging vendors pursuing the PaaS market. However, despite its inclusion on some of these lists, ServiceNow is NOT a PaaS vendor seeking to compete with the likes of Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle, or even Salesforce.com. And here's why.

  - ServiceNow sells an industry- and market-leading suite of native cloud-based applications for IT service management and enterprise service automation. Those applications run atop the ServiceNow Service Automation Platform, a powerful, robust, flexible, scalable, and secure cloud-based platform built from scratch for the cloud. 

  - That platform not only runs all ServiceNow applications, but creates a single system of record for enterprise people, processes, and resources. And ServiceNow customers and partners are building modern, agile, and effective custom applications atop that very same platform. (Hence the added emphasis above.)

  - System administrators can extend the ServiceNow Service Automation Platform through right-click controls, a Web content management system, a drag-and-drop workflow engine, and more. The platform includes mobile and social technologies, and out-of-the-box integrations with hundreds of other resources — features that are available to any ServiceNow application, regardless of who builds it. And business users quickly adopt ServiceNow applications because they are as intuitive and easy to learn as the consumer Web apps those business users already use.

  - When do-it-yourselfers and contractors buy drill bits, it's not because they want or need drill bits. What they want and need are holes. Similarly, not every enterprise wants or needs a PaaS solution per se. However, every enterprise relies upon at least one custom application, and many users and administrators find their current custom apps ill-performing, user-unfriendly, and difficult or impossible to modify, modernize, or improve. In contrast, enterprises using ServiceNow are able to build and deploy effective applications rapidly, using a platform already used and approved by their IT teams.

  - The ServiceNow Service Automation Platform enables enterprises to "by-PaaS" the confusion of the PaaS market. ServiceNow customers and partners can instead focus on what matters most to them: applications and process improvements that help their businesses to be more agile, responsive, and successful.
